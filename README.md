# About Script
This script creates zones of influence throughout the city, players can score points in the zone to have some benefits from it (The benefits will be added).
The influence is presented on a scale from 0 to 1, when any organisation have more than 0.8 then the zone will be marked as occupied. 
Other organisations and police can reduce the influence points. 
When a player does something illegal (not every illegal action) in an occupied zone, members of the organisation which the zone belongs to get a notification.

Players who are members of an organisation can check the influence map.
